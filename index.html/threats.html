                             <p>Due to numerous challenges, sea turtles in Sri Lanka are now considered to be endangered or critically endangered. Along with overfishing and pollution, these dangers also include habitat loss.

                                Sea turtles are seriously endangered in Sri Lanka due to habitat destruction. Sea turtles' natural habitat has been disrupted and nesting places have been destroyed as a result of development along the shore, including the building of hotels and other tourism infrastructure. A decrease in sea turtle populations is a result of this habitat degradation.
                                
                                
                                In Sri Lanka, pollution poses additional risk to sea turtles. Sea turtles can become entangled in pollution-related plastics, such as fishing nets and plastic bags, and drown as a result. In addition to harming sea turtles and their habitats, pollution from oil spills and other harmful substances can also do so.</p>
                                <div>
                                <div class="threats-img">
                              <img src="images/SL5.jpg">
                                </div>
                                <p>Sea turtles in Sri Lanka face a third significant threat from overfishing. Injuries or fatalities can result from turtles becoming caught in fishing nets or unintentionally being caught by fisherman. Sea turtles may have a harder time surviving if overfishing depletes the food sources on which they depend.

                                    The Sri Lankan government has put in place rules and legislation to safeguard sea turtles and their environments in response to these dangers. These regulations include limitations on fishing methods like gill nets and trawling that endanger marine turtles. Sea turtles can nest without being bothered by people in protected zones that the government has designated.

                                    </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>The conservation of sea turtles is actively supported by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Sri Lanka. These groups aim to rescue and rehabilitate wounded turtles as well as spread awareness about the value of sea turtles and their habitats. Additionally, they collaborate with neighborhood groups to promote clean water and pollution reduction.

                                        Sea turtles in Sri Lanka still face serious risks despite these initiatives. To safeguard the existence of these stunning species and ensure that future generations may enjoy them, it is critical that individuals, governments, and organizations continue to collaborate.</p>
